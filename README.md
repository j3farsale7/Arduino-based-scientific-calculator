# Arduino-based-scientific-calculator
This Arduino-based scientific calculator supports 24 trigonometric functions, logarithms, powers, and square roots. It uses a custom 6x6 keypad and a 16x2 LCD screen. The project is designed to help learn about Arduino interfacing, implementing mathematical algorithms, and building custom input systems without external libraries.
